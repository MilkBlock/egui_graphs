# Changelog

## v0.28.0 (23.08.2025)

#### üÜï New Features

A lot of work done on Demo. The most important is that we are web now!

‚Äî How to try it:

1. Open the web demo and pick an example:
   - [bipartite.json](https://blitzar-tech.github.io/egui_graphs/#g=bipartite.json)
   - [tree_binary.json](https://blitzar-tech.github.io/egui_graphs/#g=tree_binary.json)
2. Tweak Layout ‚Üí Force-Directed/Hierarchical and play with Animation/Forces.
3. Click Export (top of the right panel) ‚Üí choose ‚ÄúInclude Layout‚Äù and/or ‚ÄúNode Positions‚Äù, then save to File or copy to Clipboard.
4. To import, go to the Import/Load tab ‚Üí ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù (or drag & drop a JSON file into the graph area). Your uploads appear under ‚ÄúUser Uploads‚Äù.
5. On web, use Share to copy a deep link to the selected example.

- More useful keybindings were added (fit to screen (once), pan to graph)
- File import and export ‚Äî planned to migrate to `egui_graphs` core in upcoming releases

Notes:

- New import/export features are in the demo UI only (not yet in the `egui_graphs` crate). Core support is planned.
- Positions are optional on import; if missing, nodes are placed in a circle initially.

#### üñ•Ô∏è  Demo

- File import:
  - User uploads with JSON schema support
    - Edges-only
    - Nodes and edges
    - Graph plus layout properties
  - Curated example graphs
  - Shareable deep links (see Highlights above)
- File export:
  - Optional include of layout and graph settings
- Demo UX improvements:
  - Debug overlay and instructional messages queue
  - Navigation keybindings and help button
  - Hierarchical layout controls and perf metrics panel

#### üõ†Ô∏è Fixes & Robustness

- Do not send zero-diff events (core)
